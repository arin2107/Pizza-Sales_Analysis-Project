## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

1. 🎁 **Loyalty Program with Surprise Bonuses**  
   Introduce a point-based loyalty system with occasional surprise multipliers to encourage more frequent purchases.

2. 📅 **Sunday Optimization Strategy**  
   Consider shorter working hours on Sundays and offer BOGO (Buy One Get One) flash deals to maintain sales while reducing team fatigue.

3. 🍽️ **User-Created Menu Items**  
   Let customers create their own pizza combinations. Top-rated creations can be added to the menu with the creator's name.

4. 🎃 **Seasonal Specials**  
   Launch themed pizzas during months with low sales (like October for Halloween) to drive engagement and seasonal buzz.

5. 📣 **Customer Feedback Collection**  
   Collect year-end feedback to uncover areas for menu or service improvement based on real customer preferences.

6. 🍕 **Revamp XL and XXL Offers**  
   Introduce “half-n-half” pizza options in larger sizes to cater to group orders and improve sales in that segment.
